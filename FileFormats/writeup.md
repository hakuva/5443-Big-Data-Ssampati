Program 1- Assignment 1
========================

## Conversion:

I choose to use the CSV file to convert to JSON file.

In order to convert it into an JSON i choose to use Python language.

python have packages to import the CSV and JSON

then load the input file and then specify the fields that in the CSV file.

now dump the file into JSON

Then the output must be sent to a file with an extension of .json


The file process is too large for the digital ocean server so it was repeatedly killing the process.

so i had to run it on CS2 server and create the JSON file.

You can find GpsFilePoints.json in cs2.mwsu.edu/~ssampati/GpsFilePoints.json

Created JSON file is 531 MB in size

## Compression:


All files compressed size and the percentage of conversion is given below.

| Format		| original      | Gzip        | zip      | Percentage	|
|---------------|---------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| CSV		    | 484 MB	    | 59 MB       | 59 MB    | 	88%			|
| SQL		    | 467 MB	    | 60 MB       | 60 MB    | 	87%			|
| XML		    | 2.3 GB	    | 75 MB       | 75 MB    | 	97%			|
| YAML	    	| 771 MB	    | 61 MB       | 61 MB    | 	92%			|

By the data from the above table .XML compresses the most with 97%.
